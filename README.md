# mintpatti

- Ethereum blockchain research project

Building:

- A contract for creating and updating a message on the Ethereum blockchain

- A contract for minting tokens, then allowing the owner of the contract to send tokens to others and to read the token balances, and for owners of the new tokens to also send them to others.

# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
